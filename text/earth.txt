It is a time of peace.
You work as a gunner on an astroid defense ship.
---
It's a boring job.
---
You wonder if there's some way to get out of this job.
---
Some way you could just play Tetris all day with your cat.
---
You work alone, separated from the rest of the crew in case
the gun overheats and explodes.
