Possible ways to dynamically adjust settings
* use a smaller canvas, transform it up
* draw less stars

Speed questions:
* is React slowing down the editor? Why is highlighting code so slow?



Speed seems to go with number of pixels drawn of canvas (big sprites are expensive)
Does building a background canvas or changing the background image work better?

Big planets were a problem until I turned off the moving image background of the canvas.

Seems like it wasn't so much the background image as the parallax of it.
(updating the offset of the canvas background)

Huh, maybe unrelated to parallax, because now working fine with .1 bg movement? Really confusing. Yeah now I can see slow framerates at no parallax and good ones with parrallax. Perhaps some JIT-shit kicking in?

Firefox seems to scale more with the size of the canvas

better get ship sprites working before drawing too many conclusions

idea: two canvases, one for background stars + planets, other for ships

idea: clear all regions, then draw again (instead of clearing whole screen)

Question: is it better to use a moving background or to render some stars each time?
